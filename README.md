# Credit-Risk-Analysis-for-extending-Bank-Loans

__About Problem:__

Credit scoring is a classification problem where the objective is to predict whether or not an individual will default on their credit.

Credit scoring is perhaps one of the most "classic" applications for predictive modeling, to predict whether or not credit extended to an applicant will likely result in profit or losses for the lending institution.

There are many variations and complexities regarding how exactly credit is extended to individuals, businesses, and other organizations for various purposes (purchasing equipment, real estate, consumer items, and so on), and using various methods of credit (credit card, loan, delayed payment plan). But in all cases, the lender provides money to an individual or institution and expects to be paid back in time with interest commensurate with the risk of default.
